      <h2 class="pb-3">Front-end developer, based in NYC</h2>
    <p>Like many developers, my path to programming wasn't exactly straightforward. With a degree and background in Education, I spent my "first career" working as a classroom teacher and, later, an administrator. I was passionate about teaching, but loved learning more.</p>
    <p>I started learning to code on a whim and it quickly became like a book I couldn't put down. After years of teaching kids to read and count, it was exciting to solve complex problems again and creatively build new things.</p>
    <p>Now, I still use a lot of the strengths I developed as a teacher, like communication, empathy, and lots of patience on a daily basis as a developer. Being a teacher has also made me an expert in learning so I'm constantly growing my skills.</p>
